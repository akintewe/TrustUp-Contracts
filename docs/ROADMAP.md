- Share calculation accuracy
- Withdrawal scenarios (partial, full)
- Interest distribution
- Low liquidity edge cases
- Share value appreciation

## Critical Blockers

### 1. SC-19 / SC-20: Broader integration and pool test depth ⚠️

**Impact:** MEDIUM
**Current Issue:** Core contracts are implemented, but cross-contract verification still relies partly on mocks or ignored cases.
**Effort:** Medium

---

## Next Steps (Recommended Order)

1. **Immediate**
   - [ ] Replace mocked pool assertions in CreditLine tests with concrete integration coverage
   - [ ] Expand repayment/default accounting tests across contract boundaries

2. **Short Term**
   - [ ] Complete SC-20 liquidity pool test expansion
   - [ ] Add more end-to-end multi-contract flows without mocked externals

3. **Polish**
   - [ ] Integration testing across all contracts
   - [ ] Security audit preparation
   - [ ] Gas optimization
   - [ ] Documentation updates

---

## Notes

- All completed phases (1-2) have excellent test coverage
- CreditLine now supports priced loans, reputation-linked limits, and pending-loan cancellation
- No integration tests exist yet between contracts
- Security considerations documented in [ERROR_CODES.md](ERROR_CODES.md)
